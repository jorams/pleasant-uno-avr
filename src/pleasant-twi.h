 * Pleasant TWI allows you to work with the device's TWI module, to communicate

 * The TWI module can operate both as a master and a slave, and both operating
 * modes are supported by Pleasant TWI. It does not have support for repeated
 * starts.
 *
 * Note that unlike the rest of Pleasant Uno AVR, Pleasant TWI is released
